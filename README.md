python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        (on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)


3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Create the .env file
Make a .env file in the root folder with these values:



DB_NAME= your db name
DB_USER= your postgres user
DB_PASSWORD= your db password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

Edit as needed for your PostgreSQL setup.

5. Set up the database
Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the fx_scraper database exists.
Then run this SQL to create the rates table:



CREATE TABLE rates (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
provider TEXT,
from_currency TEXT,
to_currency TEXT,
rate NUMERIC,
fee NUMERIC,
timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
);

6. Run the application
